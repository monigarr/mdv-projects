I chose a funny photo I shot of my husband Walter, during one of our past adventures in the Caribbean.  I added a background image that symbolizes the Iroquois Confederacy that we both belong to, as members of the Mohawk Tribe. I traced around Walter’s head and shoulders and removed the original background image of drapery.  Then I converted the image of Walter to black and white.  He has black hair, so the resulting image has very little detail left for his hair. I created a separate layer for each color that I added to Walter’s head, before I merged all the layers to one layer.  I chose dark colors because Walter’s skin and hair is naturally dark.  I resized the image to be 1/4th the size of the entire canvas.  Next, I duplicated the image 3 times and moved the duplicated images to each corner of the canvas. I changed the hue / saturation settings of each duplicated image, to create a complimentary color setting on each corner of the canvas. I rotated the images on the right side of the canvas so that they represent a mirror image of the left side of the canvas to symbolize the duality of Walter’s personality. I like the texture of Jasper John’s pop art and decided to add some texture to my digital painting by creating a pattern overlay with ‘exclusion’ setting.  Then I added another layer and drew a box the same color as Walter’s skin tone at the top left of the canvas.  I set this layer to have an opacity of  44%, then I added a pattern overlay of a tiny square dot and set it’s mode to ‘dissolve’. To create more texture and grunge that I see in many of Jasper Johns’ images, I used the eraser tool with various brush settings to randomly erase small scratches off the entire image.  Finally, I added more texture to the background with the eraser tool and various pattern and gradient overlays."]
